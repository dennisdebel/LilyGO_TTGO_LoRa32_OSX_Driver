# LilyGO_TTGO_LoRa32_OSX_Driver
Driver for Mac OSX Catalina 10.15


Spending an ineffable amount of time finding the right driver for my outdated machine for usage with the [this](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/met-lora/lilygo-ttgo-lora32-868mhz-esp32) mircorcontroller, I stumbled upon an [issue](https://github.com/LilyGO/LILYGO-T-OI/issues/3) where [someone](https://github.com/eschwim) offered a custom compiled (and signed) driver they got from the manufacturer hosted on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XY9kOZ1EUEC6M5IrDPSYzNRRJ1k6VkwL/view?usp=sharing). If not dodgy enough, this was the only driver that worked for my combination of hard and software. I hope its clean, I hope it will help you. Uploading it here for safekeeping.
